    <h3>Description</h3> 
    <p>Chewy peanut butter cookies that will satisfy that sweet tooth craving. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Peanut Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Combine the peanut butter and sugar in a medium bowl. Mix together with a fork or rubber spatula until the sugar is fully incorporated into the peanut butter. Stir in the milk.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the flour, baking soda, and salt to the peanut butter mixture, mixing until the mixture becomes unified in texture. The batter will be thick.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Scoop about 2 tablespoons of the dough, then squeeze a couple times in your hand to bring the cookie dough together and roll into a ball. Place onto a greased or parchment-lined cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.
        <br><br>(If you prefer a sugary crunch to your cookie, you can roll the balls in demerara or granulated sugar at this point.)</li>
            <br>
        <li>Use the tines of a clean fork to press indentations onto the tops in a crosshatch design.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Baked until the cookies are lightly golden and cracked on top, 12 to 14 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Let cool for 2 to 3 minutes on the cookie sheet before transferring to a cooling rack. Enjoy warm or cool to room temperature and transfer to an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
