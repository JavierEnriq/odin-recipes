    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>"Everything" bagel seasoning isn't just for bagels - it's also delicious on asparagus! Certain bagel seasoning brands are saltier than others, so hold off on adding salt until the end, if needed.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound thin asparagus</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon everything bagel seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 wedge (blank)s lemon wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse and trim asparagus, cutting off any woody ends. Place asparagus on a plate and drizzle with olive oil. Toss with bagel seasoning until evenly combined. Place asparagus in the air fryer basket in a single layer. Work in batches if needed.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Air fry until slightly soft, tossing with tongs halfway through, 5 to 6 minutes. Taste and season with salt if needed. Serve with lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
